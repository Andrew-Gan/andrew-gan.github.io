Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the [School of ECE](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/), working with Professor [Zahra Ghodsi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/Faculty/ptProfile?resource_id=270860&group_id=2571) in the [Trustworthy and Collaborative Learning Systems (TCLS)](https://zahra.page/) lab.

We work on integrating machine learning, privacy & security and hardware acceleration to build practical and secure intelligent systems. I am open to collaborating with researchers on fun and exciting topics.

## Bio
I transferred from Taylor's University in Malaysia to Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN and graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering in 2020. After a brief period in Chicago working as a software test automation engineer, I went to graduate school at Purdue and received a Masters in ECE in 2024 before continuing to PhD. I hope to become a researcher in the industry and embed research ideas into market innovations that benefit many.

## Research

My work is strongly tied to Security and Privacy, Accelerator Architecture and Machine Learning. My motivation for this field stems from a desire to bridge the performance goals of the accelerator community and the security concerns of the cryptographic community in an ever-growing ML landscape.

Promoting security at the cost of performance is difficult, so the key is to develop security frameworks that cooperate with performance-driven hardware. I have designed GPU accelerated frameworks for privacy-preserving computation, ML artifact authentication and ML training with differential privacy. I am also involved in the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), part of the Linux Foundation.
