I am a PhD candidate in the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://purdue.edu/), under the advice of [Professor Zahra Ghodsi](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE/People/Faculty/ptProfile?resource_id=270860&group_id=2571).

At Purdue, I am a researcher in the Trustworthy and Collaborative Learning Systems (TCLS) lab. We work on integrating ML, security and hardware acceleration to build practical and secure intelligent systems. I am open to collaboration with other researchers regardless of academic department or location of institution.

## Bio
I attended Taylor's University in Malaysia before transferring to Purdue University at West Lafayette and graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering in 2020. After a brief period in the industry, I went to graduate school at Purdue and received a Masters in ECE in 2024 before continuing on to PhD candidacy. I hope to enter the industry as a researcher in my related field.

## Research
<img src="../images/research.png" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

My work is related to Security and Privacy, Accelerator Architecture and Machine Learning. My motivation for this field stems from a desire to bridge the performance goals of the accelerator community and the security concerns of the cryptographic community in an ever-growing ML landscape. I have built GPU acceleration for privacy-preserving computation, frameworks for authenticating ML artifacts on the GPU and enhancing ML training with differential privacy within an accelerated GPU framework.
